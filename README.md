# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React.

This is made to be the second version of my previous pathfinding project made with C++ igraphics. But then added some more visualizations too.  

So far there are 5 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Binary Search Game


## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A star
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Archimedes Spiral
- N Queen Backtracking
- Binary Search


I am not sure if anyone would like to contribute to this project or not. But any kind of contributions are welcomes. Also if you like this please star this repo. It keeps me motivated.

### Acknowledgement

I took inspirations from the following sources for some of the segments.
